# Mobile-Development-Math-Quiz
This quiz application is designed for **_YEAR 1_** primary school students to use as an education mobile quiz app based on Android platform.

This project is to aim to demonstrate my ability to design and implement a Mobile Application consisting
of a set of Kotlin, using Android Studio and SQLite to build a suitable user interface, to implement
event handling procedures that provide a basis for an interactive and user-friendly app and adhere to
standard principles of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and appropriately classes.

In the beginning, the app requires the student to insert the name, then select "start" button to begin
the math quiz.

The app display 14 questions with multiple choice (4) for each question with **_ONE_** correct answer. These
questions are display randomly from the questions pool that contains 42 questions. The questions set
cover the 7 topics provided below. Two questions from each topic. When the student finishes the quiz by
selecting the "finish" button, the app display the test grade. Also, the app will save the test result
